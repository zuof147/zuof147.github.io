                Flowers of Fire: Illustrations from Japanese Fireworks
                Catalogues (ca. 1880s)
            </h1>
            <p>
                The spinning saxon, flying pigeons, polka batteries, jumping
                jacks and firecrackers, squibs and salutes, Aztec Fountains,
                Bengal Lights, and Egyptian Circlets, bangers or bungers, cakes,
                crossettes, candles, and a Japanese design known as kamuro (boys
                haircut), which looks like a bobbed wig teased out across the
                stratosphere. . . the language of fireworks has a richness that
                hints at the explosive payload it references. And yet, anyone
                who has ever held their camera up to the blazing sky knows that
                a brilliant firework show can rarely be captured to any
                satisfying degree. Perhaps this is what makes a
                nineteenth-century series of catalogue advertisements for
                Japanese fireworks so mesmerizing: denied the expectations of
                photorealism, these images are free to evoke a unique sense of
                visual wonder.

                Thought to have been invented in China around the second century
                BCE, fireworks began as modest bamboo sparklers, advancing
                toward today’s complex pyrotechnic spectacles with the piecemeal
                discovery of saltpeter, gunpowder, tubular projectiles, and
                colorizing salts. While Chinese and European firework histories
                are heavily documented, Japan’s traditions remain moderately
                more obscure. Despite excellent pyrotechnic craftsmanship, for
                example, it was still possible for researchers to write, as
                recently as 2010, that “comprehensive information encompassing
                the development of fireworks culture in Japan, the history, and
                any intricate symbolism, is not widely known or appreciated
                within Japan, let alone abroad.”
