        <p>The title of the album says, "As long as I try to live
          seriously as
          a person, I 'm sure that everyone has a moratorium moment
          that can't
          fit into society, so I want to say,'It's not guilty' for
          myself." It
          contains the message of the apple . The abbreviation of the
          title is "MM", which is taken from the heads of "innocence"

          production
          intention is to substitute for my own musical business card,
          such as
          playing music, so that the listener can understand that he
          is
          "musically such a person". I made it with the intention.
          Since this
          is my first presentation of my method, I dare to deform it
          so that
          it is easy to understand, and when there is a difference
          from the
          demo I made by myself, I am especially careful to correct it
          so that
          it will not be misunderstood musically. It is said that was
