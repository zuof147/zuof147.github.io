        <div class="griditem1">Because one day in our early lives as women, everything changes. We
            start bleeding. And in an instant we’re no longer a child. I was on
            a crazy golf course overlooking Cromer pier when I experienced
            period pain for the first time. My lower body rippled with a new
            sensation. It was a pain that didn’t fit inside my body, burning
            through my thighs. I explained to Dad that I didn’t feel well. I was
            aware of the shift in his gaze towards me in a way that I absolutely
            did not have the language for. That British coastal perfume, thick
            with sun-roasted kelp and old deep-fat-fryer oil, took the nausea
            that came with these sharp churns to another level. I had to sit
            down on the grass. The pain spoke to me. It told me my human fabric
            had changed. As evidence of the encoding that happened, now when I
            hear seagulls, I still have flash visions of lying down holding my
            belly.
            <br>
            <br>
            I’m in my mid-30s now and my periods have always been a physical and
            mental slog. It is thought that 90% of women experience some
            premenstrual changes, even if mildly. There are more than 150
            clinically identified symptoms of PMS, including irritability,
            anxiety, depression and headaches. A laugh riot, in other words.
            I have spent years trying to gain autonomy over the way my hormones
            seem to make my mind and body behave. Around five years ago,
            prompted by a breakdown-of-sorts, I sought help for the anxiety I
            had done my very best to conceal from everyone, including myself,
            for well over a decade. After talking to my GP, I tried all sorts of
            interventions in my quest for emotional stability. I was referred to
            (almost exclusively male) gynaecologists whose conversations and
            hormonal prescriptions made me feel either a) madder or b) ever so
            slightly less mad for a short amount of time. I tried acupuncture,
            vitamin supplements and diet changes. I realised this precise,
            reliable emotional state I sought was elusive at best.
            <br>
            <br>
            Instead, I was surprised by a growing sense of peace. Addressing the
            patterns of my mood with a therapist, we looked closely at the shame
            I attached to being sensitive, sad or scared in the second half of
            my cycle and asked where it came from. After researching anxiety, I
            started training to become a psychologist and began researching
            hormones. I started to see things in a way I never thought I would.
            I had a new question, and that was: what am I seeking relief from?
            I’ve come to believe that greater awareness of our hormonal
            processes can help us not only to manage our corresponding moods,
            but also to conceptualise what a mood actually is: a state of being
            that is, by its nature, temporary, and rarely directly attributable
            to one thing. It’s an interesting dichotomy, that we can be quite
            disconnected from what’s actually going on when our hormones are
            fluctuating – when oestrogen dramatically rises, for example, during
            ovulation – and yet be so ready to self-police when we feel anything
            other than sanguine and pain-free.
            <br>
            <br>
            We blame so much on being “hormonal”: irrationality, “bad”
            decision-making, angry outbursts, low self-esteem. That wasn’t the
            real me, we might think, agonising over a knee-jerk decision we made
            at work, or taking offence at a throwaway comment in the pub. It was
            my hormones. The same phrase could cover everything from wanting to
            kill your partner at the dinner table to having frantic sex with
            them on it.
<br>
<br>
            In some ways, “hormonal” is the modern-day “hysterical” – a word
            most women will have their own associations with. Mine are profuse.
            Years and years of secretly believing that I am just on the cusp of
            losing control: of my emotions, my appetite, my sexuality.
            Sometimes, I think I’m a hair-trigger away from exploding. Because
            I’ve quietly believed I’m… well, too much. Almost every woman I have
            known well has spoken of this belief; one they mostly keep tucked
            up, because admitting the fear means facing the idea that maybe we
            don’t have inherent autonomy; that our woman-ness will always “get”
            us in the end. What if there was a different way of looking at
            things? What if we could work towards dismantling the self-blame
            and, therefore, stop othering this fundamental part of who we are?
            Acknowledging that the stigma surrounding female reproductive
            processes is still alive and well is the first rung, I think, on the
            ladder towards self-acceptance. Most women know the crack of relief
            when someone dares to start talking about periods, the reality of
            birth, miscarriage or menopause, and other women say, oh thank God.
            This stigma is like an iceberg. The tip above the surface is women’s
            day-to-day suffering with whatever process they’re going through; a
            suffering they feel unable to fully express, perhaps through fear of
            embarrassment, of disgusting others or that they’ll be dismissed.
            Underneath the surface is the way women’s health and pain has been,
            still is, viewed and treated in society.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is sweet fantasy to say that all the myths, misinformation and
            ickiness surrounding female reproductive processes have been –
            finally – banished into the fusty past. It’s silly, really, because
            the word “hormonal” applies as much to a testosterone-charged City
            banker as it does to a woman about to have her period. The metabolic
            processes of all organisms can only take place in very specific
            chemical environments and, in the human body, hormones are special
            chemical messengers that, as part of the endocrine system, help to
            control most major bodily functions. Male, female, or anywhere on
            the spectrum of gender, hormones keep us alive. Yet “hormonal” is
            still a tool for explaining away a woman’s experience of her
            changing biochemistry. And so we try and keep schtum, lest we be
            slapped with such a historically damaging label: hysterical.
            <br>
            <br>
            When I effectively ran out of PMS treatment options, it made me
            realise how entrenched my analysis of my own thoughts and behaviour
            was in more general ideas of how I “should” or “shouldn’t” be as a
            woman. In therapy and in my psychological study, I realised how the
            workings of my inner world are often in collision with the outer
            world and all the expectations I perceive it to have of me. A better
            understanding of what goes on inside us, of the connection between
            our bodies and minds, is an important part of reclaiming meaning. We
            are not post-biology. We are protecting no one by pretending that we
            don’t bleed. We are not protecting ourselves by ignoring the
            external factors that may affect our bodily experiences, including
            the way modern medicine still doesn’t take the variance of women’s
            pain – or the voice describing that pain – seriously.
            <br>
            <br>
            Women can wait between four and 10 years after first seeing a doctor
            with symptoms of endometriosis and a diagnosis. The average is
            seven-and-a-half years. In 2017, the National Institute for Health
            and Care Excellence released guidelines urging GPs not to overlook
            symptoms of the disorder, because for it to be repeatedly inferred
            that you are overreacting to your pain, your experience of that pain
            is going to become stained with confusion, fear and guilt. It is
            difficult to argue that medicine does not have an inherent bias
            against women. Women presenting at hospitals with pain are not only
            given fewer painkillers than men, but are often offered sedatives
            instead. Treatment for women with coronary heart disease is delayed
            compared to men. All these facts are corroborated by robust data.
            When a woman says how she feels, what she wants or what she needs,
            someone always knows better.
            <br>
            <br>
            Knowing ourselves better gives us the power to ask for better. For
            example, I used to panic sometimes at the pain I can have with
            ovulation. I knew I always felt it, but didn’t know why. Learning
            that mittelschmerz (the German words for “middle” and “pain”) is
            thought to be caused by one of our eggs rupturing through a sac
            (follicle) on an ovary, releasing fluid and a small amount of blood
            that can travel through the ovary wall and irritate nerves in the
            lining of the abdominal cavity, was a strange comfort. So, too, was
            learning from a prominent gynaecologist that he has seen women
            presenting in A&E in tears with acute pelvic pain, whose only
            clinically significant finding turns out to be recent ovulation.
            This shit is real and it hurts. What’s sad is that my private
            experience alone didn’t feel like good enough evidence to finally
            ask for pain relief.
            <br>
            <br>
            On some level, a focus on a woman’s changing biochemistry throughout
            her cycle – or any other reproductive process – might be seen to
            remove some of the stigma. It’s just my hormones. That there could
            be a clear, chemical “reason” for a certain type of behaviour or way
            of feeling is, on the surface, legitimising and reassuring.
            Although, if any woman is able to ride out days of feeling low each
            month by being aware of her cycle patterns; or finds that telling
            herself that the way she’s feeling is “just chemical” is a strategy
            that stops her going up into that second gear of self-analysis and
            existential woe, I absolutely lift my hat to her. Personally, given
            what I now know about the imprecision of the science of how our
            hormones can affect our mood, I try to resist thinking that I am a
            chemically controlled robot. I try to see my distress as part of a
            mini-ecosystem that includes my changing hormones, asking myself:
            what else is going on to upset my mind? How physically well am I
            right now? What helps?
            <br>
            <br>
            Research tells us that our hormonal fluctuations do seem to affect
            how chemical signals pass through our brain – as any neuroscientist
            would tell you, we just don’t know exactly how or why. In all fields
            of brain study it is accepted that mental distress is not caused by
            one thing in isolation. The electrical, chemical brain is not
            extricable from the subjective mind. What we talk about is
            multi-causality: a fancy word for the concept that lots of different
            factors contribute to how we feel mentally. Therefore, when we talk
            about processes happening in a woman’s body that place us at
            “increased risk” of depression or anxiety, it seems not just
            blindingly logical, but respectful to consider that body in the
            wider scheme of things.
            <br>
            <br>
            Perhaps, then, a more realistic phrase than, “It’s just my
            hormones,” would be, “My hormones might predispose me to feeling
            terrible sometimes.”
            <br>
            <br>
            Our fluctuating biology is not the whole story but a significant
            part of our emotional lives. The hormonal changes and symptoms of
            menopause are very real and can be very hard. When my hormone levels
            change, notably at ovulation (soaring oestrogen) and in the week
            before I get my period (soaring progestogen, high oestrogen), it
            really can feel like I’ve stepped inside the skin of a different
            person – that I am not myself. But what is “myself” if not a
            sensitive-by-design brain and body that is always changing and
            responding to the world it inhabits and the people around it? From
            what fixed, ideal state do I feel I am slipping when I am more
            emotional for the second half of the month?
            <br>
            <br>
            As human beings, rhythm is part of our deep core. Breathing,
            pumping, contracting: these are all actions of the body that keep us
            alive and keep our species going. Menstruation is another rhythm
            unique to women. But while our biology and what is happening inside
            us is important, we cannot act as if the body is an anatomical
            drawing floating in space; that it is nowhere. Clearly, if a woman’s
            premenstrual distress is such that she feels unable to function, she
            should, in an ideal world, be receiving dedicated healthcare and
            support. Is there something wider we should be asking about how, as
            a society, we frame what women say and do when they are anything
            other than sanguine, nurturing and polite?
            <br>
            <br>
            Are we saving up anger, our base need for affection, and our tears
            for three weeks of the month? As our hormonal levels shift, could
            they be acting as a kind of “truth serum”, lubricating the passage
            of what we really want to say or do? It’s a radical idea and I quite
            like it. What if what we feel during those times of the month when
            we are so quick to say we are being irrational is the most “real” we
            are? The science surrounding whatever signalling changes happen in
            the emotion-processing parts of our brain during the menstrual cycle
            is too fuzzy to definitively say otherwise. Could it be that, when
            the mantle of self-censorship drops and we are less caught up with
            fearing how we’ll be seen, we’re accessing all that historical
            oppression and, in short bursts, letting it go? All that so-called
            “excess”, the stuff that makes a woman “hysterical” could just be…
            truth.
