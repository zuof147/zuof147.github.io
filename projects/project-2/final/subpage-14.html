        <p>
            On some level, a focus on a woman’s changing biochemistry throughout
            her cycle – or any other reproductive process – might be seen to
            remove some of the stigma. It’s just my hormones. That there could
            be a clear, chemical “reason” for a certain type of behaviour or way
            of feeling is, on the surface, legitimising and reassuring.
            <br>
            <br>
            Although, if any woman is able to ride out days of feeling low each
            month by being aware of her cycle patterns; or finds that telling
            herself that the way she’s feeling is “just chemical” is a strategy
            that stops her going up into that second gear of self-analysis and
            existential woe, I absolutely lift my hat to her. Personally, given
            what I now know about the imprecision of the science of how our
            hormones can affect our mood, I try to resist thinking that I am a
            chemically controlled robot. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I try to see my distress as part of a
            mini-ecosystem that includes my changing hormones, asking myself:
            what else is going on to upset my mind? How physically well am I
            right now? What helps? Research tells us that our hormonal
            fluctuations do seem to affect how chemical signals pass through our
            brain – as any neuroscientist would tell you, we just don’t know
            exactly how or why. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In all fields of brain study it is accepted that
            mental distress is not caused by one thing in isolation. The
            electrical, chemical brain is not extricable from the subjective
            mind. What we talk about is multi-causality: a fancy word for the
            concept that lots of different factors contribute to how we feel
            mentally. Therefore, when we talk about processes happening in a
            woman’s body that place us at “increased risk” of depression or
            anxiety, it seems not just blindingly logical, but respectful to
            consider that body in the wider scheme of things.
