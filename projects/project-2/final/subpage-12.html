            Women can wait between four and 10 years after first seeing a doctor
            with symptoms of endometriosis and a diagnosis. The average is
            seven-and-a-half years.
            <br>
            <br>
            In 2017, the National Institute for Health
            and Care Excellence released guidelines urging GPs not to overlook
            symptoms of the disorder, because for it to be repeatedly inferred
            that you are overreacting to your pain, your experience of that pain
            is going to become stained with confusion, fear and guilt. It is
            difficult to argue that medicine does not have an inherent bias
            against women.
            <br>
            <br>
            Women presenting at hospitals with pain are not only
            given fewer painkillers than men, but are often offered sedatives
            instead. Treatment for women with coronary heart disease is delayed
            compared to men. All these facts are corroborated by robust data.
            When a woman says how she feels, what she wants or what she needs,
            someone always knows better.
