                            In the rush-hour train one evening last summer, I
                            looked
                            around at all the women
                            in the carriage. Middle-aged women hurtling towards
                            the
                            suburbs. Pregnant women
                            holding their lower backs. Teenage girls slick with
                            sebum.
                            Elderly women
                            standing stoically by the doors. I realised every
                            one of
                            them will have some
                            story about how their reproductive systems have
                            affected
                            their lives. And I
                            thought: how much have you kept secret?

                    Because one day in our early lives as women, everything
                    changes. We start
                    bleeding. And in an instant we’re no longer a child. I was
                    on a crazy golf
                    course overlooking Cromer pier when I experienced period
                    pain for the first
                    time. My lower body rippled with a new sensation. It was a
                    pain that didn’t fit
                    inside my body, burning through my thighs. I explained to
                    Dad that I didn’t feel
                    well. I was aware of the shift in his gaze towards me in a
                    way that I absolutely
                    did not have the language for. That British coastal perfume,
                    thick with
                    sun-roasted kelp and old deep-fat-fryer oil, took the nausea
                    that came with
                    these sharp churns to another level. I had to sit down on
                    the grass. The pain
                    spoke to me. It told me my human fabric had changed. As
                    evidence of the encoding
                    that happened, now when I hear seagulls, I still have flash
                    visions of lying
                    down holding my belly.

                    I’m in my mid-30s now and my periods have always been a
                    physical and mental
                    slog. It is thought that 90% of women experience some
                    premenstrual changes, even
                    if mildly. There are more than 150 clinically identified
                    symptoms of PMS,
                    including irritability, anxiety, depression and headaches. A
                    laugh riot, in
                    other words.

                    I have spent years trying to gain autonomy over the way my
                    hormones seem to make
                    my mind and body behave. Around five years ago, prompted by
                    a
                    breakdown-of-sorts, I sought help for the anxiety I had done
                    my very best to
                    conceal from everyone, including myself, for well over a
                    decade. After talking
                    to my GP, I tried all sorts of interventions in my quest for
                    emotional
                    stability. I was referred to (almost exclusively male)
                    gynaecologists whose
                    conversations and hormonal prescriptions made me feel either
                    a) madder or b)
                    ever so slightly less mad for a short amount of time. I
                    tried acupuncture,
                    vitamin supplements and diet changes. I realised this
                    precise, reliable
                    emotional state I sought was elusive at best.

                    Instead, I was surprised by a growing sense of peace.
                    Addressing the patterns of
                    my mood with a therapist, we looked closely at the shame I
                    attached to being
                    sensitive, sad or scared in the second half of my cycle and
                    asked where it came
                    from. After researching anxiety, I started training to
                    become a psychologist and
                    began researching hormones. I started to see things in a way
                    I never thought I
                    would. I had a new question, and that was: what am I seeking
                    relief from?

                    I’ve come to believe that greater awareness of our hormonal
                    processes can help
                    us not only to manage our corresponding moods, but also to
                    conceptualise what a
                    mood actually is: a state of being that is, by its nature,
                    temporary, and rarely
                    directly attributable to one thing. It’s an interesting
                    dichotomy, that we can
                    be quite disconnected from what’s actually going on when our
                    hormones are
                    fluctuating – when oestrogen dramatically rises, for
                    example, during ovulation –
                    and yet be so ready to self-police when we feel anything
                    other than sanguine and
                    pain-free.

                    We blame so much on being “hormonal”: irrationality, “bad”
                    decision-making,
                    angry outbursts, low self-esteem. That wasn’t the real me,
                    we might think,
                    agonising over a knee-jerk decision we made at work, or
                    taking offence at a
                    throwaway comment in the pub. It was my hormones. The same
                    phrase could cover
                    everything from wanting to kill your partner at the dinner
                    table to having
                    frantic sex with them on it.

                    In some ways, “hormonal” is the modern-day “hysterical” – a
                    word most women will
                    have their own associations with. Mine are profuse. Years
                    and years of secretly
                    believing that I am just on the cusp of losing control: of
                    my emotions, my
                    appetite, my sexuality. Sometimes, I think I’m a
                    hair-trigger away from
                    exploding. Because I’ve quietly believed I’m… well, too
                    much. Almost every woman
                    I have known well has spoken of this belief; one they mostly
                    keep tucked up,
                    because admitting the fear means facing the idea that maybe
                    we don’t have
                    inherent autonomy; that our woman-ness will always “get” us
                    in the end. What if
                    there was a different way of looking at things? What if we
                    could work towards
                    dismantling the self-blame and, therefore, stop othering
                    this fundamental part
                    of who we are?

                    Acknowledging that the stigma surrounding female
                    reproductive processes is still
                    alive and well is the first rung, I think, on the ladder
                    towards
                    self-acceptance. Most women know the crack of relief when
                    someone dares to start
                    talking about periods, the reality of birth, miscarriage or
                    menopause, and other
                    women say, oh thank God. This stigma is like an iceberg. The
                    tip above the
                    surface is women’s day-to-day suffering with whatever
                    process they’re going
                    through; a suffering they feel unable to fully express,
                    perhaps through fear of
                    embarrassment, of disgusting others or that they’ll be
                    dismissed. Underneath the
                    surface is the way women’s health and pain has been, still
                    is, viewed and
                    treated in society.

                    It is sweet fantasy to say that all the myths,
                    misinformation and ickiness
                    surrounding female reproductive processes have been –
                    finally – banished into
                    the fusty past. It’s silly, really, because the word
                    “hormonal” applies as much
                    to a testosterone-charged City banker as it does to a woman
                    about to have her
                    period. The metabolic processes of all organisms can only
                    take place in very
                    specific chemical environments and, in the human body,
                    hormones are special
                    chemical messengers that, as part of the endocrine system,
                    help to control most
                    major bodily functions. Male, female, or anywhere on the
                    spectrum of gender,
                    hormones keep us alive. Yet “hormonal” is still a tool for
                    explaining away a
                    woman’s experience of her changing biochemistry. And so we
                    try and keep schtum,
                    lest we be slapped with such a historically damaging label:
                    hysterical.

                    When I effectively ran out of PMS treatment options, it made
                    me realise how
                    entrenched my analysis of my own thoughts and behaviour was
                    in more general
                    ideas of how I “should” or “shouldn’t” be as a woman. In
                    therapy and in my
                    psychological study, I realised how the workings of my inner
                    world are often in
                    collision with the outer world and all the expectations I
                    perceive it to have of
                    me. A better understanding of what goes on inside us, of the
                    connection between
                    our bodies and minds, is an important part of reclaiming
                    meaning. We are not
                    post-biology. We are protecting no one by pretending that we
                    don’t bleed. We are
                    not protecting ourselves by ignoring the external factors
                    that may affect our
                    bodily experiences, including the way modern medicine still
                    doesn’t take the
                    variance of women’s pain – or the voice describing that pain
                    – seriously.

                    Women can wait between four and 10 years after first seeing
                    a doctor with
                    symptoms of endometriosis and a diagnosis. The average is
                    seven-and-a-half
                    years. In 2017, the National Institute for Health and Care
                    Excellence released
                    guidelines urging GPs not to overlook symptoms of the
                    disorder, because for it
                    to be repeatedly inferred that you are overreacting to your
                    pain, your
                    experience of that pain is going to become stained with
                    confusion, fear and
                    guilt. It is difficult to argue that medicine does not have
                    an inherent bias
                    against women. Women presenting at hospitals with pain are
                    not only given fewer
                    painkillers than men, but are often offered sedatives
                    instead. Treatment for
                    women with coronary heart disease is delayed compared to
                    men. All these facts
                    are corroborated by robust data. When a woman says how she
                    feels, what she wants
                    or what she needs, someone always knows better.

                    Knowing ourselves better gives us the power to ask for
                    better. For example, I
                    used to panic sometimes at the pain I can have with
                    ovulation. I knew I always
                    felt it, but didn’t know why. Learning that mittelschmerz
                    (the German words for
                    “middle” and “pain”) is thought to be caused by one of our
                    eggs rupturing
                    through a sac (follicle) on an ovary, releasing fluid and a
                    small amount of
                    blood that can travel through the ovary wall and irritate
                    nerves in the lining
                    of the abdominal cavity, was a strange comfort. So, too, was
                    learning from a
                    prominent gynaecologist that he has seen women presenting in
                    A&E in tears with
                    acute pelvic pain, whose only clinically significant finding
                    turns out to be
                    recent ovulation. This shit is real and it hurts. What’s sad
                    is that my private
                    experience alone didn’t feel like good enough evidence to
                    finally ask for pain
                    relief.

                    On some level, a focus on a woman’s changing biochemistry
                    throughout her cycle –
                    or any other reproductive process – might be seen to remove
                    some of the stigma.
                    It’s just my hormones. That there could be a clear, chemical
                    “reason” for a
                    certain type of behaviour or way of feeling is, on the
                    surface, legitimising and
                    reassuring. Although, if any woman is able to ride out days
                    of feeling low each
                    month by being aware of her cycle patterns; or finds that
                    telling herself that
                    the way she’s feeling is “just chemical” is a strategy that
                    stops her going up
                    into that second gear of self-analysis and existential woe,
                    I absolutely lift my
                    hat to her. Personally, given what I now know about the
                    imprecision of the
                    science of how our hormones can affect our mood, I try to
                    resist thinking that I
                    am a chemically controlled robot. I try to see my distress
                    as part of a
                    mini-ecosystem that includes my changing hormones, asking
                    myself: what else is
                    going on to upset my mind? How physically well am I right
                    now? What helps?
                    Research tells us that our hormonal fluctuations do seem to
                    affect how chemical
                    signals pass through our brain – as any neuroscientist would
                    tell you, we just
                    don’t know exactly how or why. In all fields of brain study
                    it is accepted that
                    mental distress is not caused by one thing in isolation. The
                    electrical,
                    chemical brain is not extricable from the subjective mind.
                    What we talk about is
                    multi-causality: a fancy word for the concept that lots of
                    different factors
                    contribute to how we feel mentally. Therefore, when we talk
                    about processes
                    happening in a woman’s body that place us at “increased
                    risk” of depression or
                    anxiety, it seems not just blindingly logical, but
                    respectful to consider that
                    body in the wider scheme of things.

                    Perhaps, then, a more realistic phrase than, “It’s just my
                    hormones,” would be,
                    “My hormones might predispose me to feeling terrible

                    Our fluctuating biology is not the whole story but a
                    significant part of our
                    emotional lives. The hormonal changes and symptoms of
                    menopause are very real
                    and can be very hard. When my hormone levels change, notably
                    at ovulation
                    (soaring oestrogen) and in the week before I get my period
                    (soaring progestogen,
                    high oestrogen), it really can feel like I’ve stepped inside
                    the skin of a
                    different person – that I am not myself. But what is
                    “myself” if not a
                    sensitive-by-design brain and body that is always changing
                    and responding to the
                    world it inhabits and the people around it? From what fixed,
                    ideal state do I
                    feel I am slipping when I am more emotional for the second
                    half of the month?

                    As human beings, rhythm is part of our deep core. Breathing,
                    pumping,
                    contracting: these are all actions of the body that keep us
                    alive and keep our
                    species going. Menstruation is another rhythm unique to
                    women. But while our
                    biology and what is happening inside us is important, we
                    cannot act as if the
                    body is an anatomical drawing floating in space; that it is
                    nowhere. Clearly, if
                    a woman’s premenstrual distress is such that she feels
                    unable to function, she
                    should, in an ideal world, be receiving dedicated healthcare
                    and support. Is
                    there something wider we should be asking about how, as a
                    society, we frame what
                    women say and do when they are anything other than sanguine,
                    nurturing and
                    polite?

                    Are we saving up anger, our base need for affection, and our
                    tears for three
                    weeks of the month? As our hormonal levels shift, could they
                    be acting as a kind
                    of “truth serum”, lubricating the passage of what we really
                    want to say or do?
                    It’s a radical idea and I quite like it. What if what we
                    feel during those times
                    of the month when we are so quick to say we are being
                    irrational is the most
                    “real” we are? The science surrounding whatever signalling
                    changes happen in the
                    emotion-processing parts of our brain during the menstrual
                    cycle is too fuzzy to
                    definitively say otherwise. Could it be that, when the
                    mantle of self-censorship
                    drops and we are less caught up with fearing how we’ll be
                    seen, we’re accessing
                    all that historical oppression and, in short bursts, letting
                    it go? All that
                    so-called “excess”, the stuff that makes a woman
                    “hysterical” could just be…
                    truth.
