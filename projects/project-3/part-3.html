        <p>An archive of street photography of people, events, etc. shot on
            color negatives and black and white film in NYC. <br>
            A collection of color or black and white street photography from
            1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s in NYC. </p>

            Context/Story
        </h2>
        <p>
            These collections of photograph definitely have something really
            interesting going on.
            <br>
            <br>
            The context is clearly the 1940s-1970s of America. For the United
            States, 1945–1964 was a time of high economic growth and general
            prosperity. It was also a time of confrontation as the capitalist
            United States and its allies politically opposed the Soviet Union
            and other communist states; the Cold War had begun. African
            Americans united and organized, and a triumph of the Civil Rights
            Movement ended Jim Crow segregation in the Southern United States.
            Further laws were passed that made discrimination illegal and
            provided federal oversight to guarantee voting rights.

            <br>
            The story was happening at all type of places, it is all about
            people’s lives, how they lived in this society. Different
            individuals with different personalities were gathered in this city
            and they all got their own thing to do, or interact with each other
            like talking, leaning on the wall to wait for somebody, set besides
            the road to play poker, or even fighting with bicycles holding in
            their hands.

            These photographs all have backgrounds, some are the streets,
            subways and the cars parked beside the road to show people’s
            activities in the city.

        </p>
        <h2>Quality</h2>

        <p>
            They are photographed with maybe vintage cameras. Because they are
            old photos, some of the photos are not of high resolution but it
            also shows the sense of the age.
